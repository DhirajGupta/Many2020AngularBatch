1. What are the basic requirements to build an End to End Web Application?
	a) HTML
	b) CSS
	c) Client Side Script
	       JavaScript, ECMAScript, TypeScript
	d) Server Side Scripting Tech
	       JSP, PHP, ASP.NET, Node JS etc..
	e) Database
	       MySql, Oracle, MongoDb etc..
	f) Middleware
	       Express, JsX etc..
	g) DeskTop Publishing Tools
	       Photoshop, Flash etc.
	h) IDE's
	        Visual Studio [code], Ecllipse etc..
	i) Testing Frameworks / Tools
	         XUnit, JUnit, Protractor, Jasmine,etc..

- Web started in early 1990's 
- Tim Berners Lee introduced the concept of Web.
- Web was developed at "CERN".

2. What are the Challenges in Modern Web Development?
a) Unified UX (user experience)
     - Application must provide same experience 
       across any device, ie from PC to mobile.
     - Application should not optimize.
     - Mobile users must get access to everything.

b) Fluid UX 
    - User must stay on one page and get access to
      everything from the page.
    - There should not be any page navigations.
    - New content must be added to the page without
      reloading the complete page.

c) Loosely Coupled and Extensible Architecture
     - Without stopping the application, without un-install and re-install, the new details must be pushed into the application.

d) Simiplified upgrade and deployment
    - Install and open
    - no-restart required
    - single step installation

3. What is Solution?
A. Better build - SPA [Single Page Applications] or
 	        - Progressive Web Applications
     Don't continue with traditional  web apps.

4. Can we build SPA & Progressive Web Apps using 
   JavaScript, JQuery?
A. Yes.

5. What is problem with JavaScript and JQuery? Why we are migrating to new technologies?
- ECMA Script
- JavaScript designed by - "Brendan Eich" in 1995
   [ Known as Mocha → Later as LiveScript → JS]
- JavaScript is a language used
	Client Side 	: HTML
	Server Side	: Node JS
	Database 		: MongoDb
	Animations Tools	: Flash
- Browser Compatibility Issues
- 2006 "John resig" - a library for JS - JQuery
- JQuery [Write Less and Do More]
- Reduce the Compatibility Issues

Note: A language and Library can build Application but they can't control the Application flow.


JQuery and JavaScript Issues
=========================
- Can't control application flow
- Depend on lot of events.
- lot of DOM manipulations
- lot of references
- lot of coding
- Navigation issues [ history, location ]
- Lot of Ajax explicitly
- DataBinding issues

What is Solution?
- Better use any Framework.
- Framework provides a set of libraries , language by using them we can build application.
- Framework have the ability to control the application flow.
- Like Knockout Js, Ember JS, Vue Js, Angular JS
          BackBone Js

Angular JS - Framework [Library - JavaScript]
 [MVC, MVP, MVVM, Cordova, Ionic, NativeScript]
Angular, React etc..
TypeScript
